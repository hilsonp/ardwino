# ArdWino

## Introduction

A friend, with a group of passionate, manages a vineyard.

One problem they face is the frost at the beginning of the spring.

To fight this, he plans to install huge fans and pipes that will take air from "higher" altitude and blow it above the floor. The small temperature difference should be enough. Hopefully...

## Needs

- Measure temperature at the border of the vineyard (100m from the central unit), and at 5 heights on a 12m pole placed close to the central unit.
- Drive the fans based on a logic to be defined.
- Log temperature and fan status over time.

## Description

## Use

- With the module in place
- With the ini file reflecting the actual configuration
- Make some tests to ensure that the threasholds are well respected and that the relay is well activated
- Open the ArdWino.html to analyse the published to Thingspeak

## Acknowledments
A lot of things are based on other's work.
This part needs to be completed.
